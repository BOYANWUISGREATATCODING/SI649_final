<p class="beginning">In a nation as diverse and open as the United States, the narrative of education is not just about learning and schooling; it is also a story about finance, politics, society, crime, and much more. The various influences on U.S. education are complex and continue to present issues that are yet to be solved. A significant portion of these issues can be attributed to disparities and injustices within the educational system, most of which stem from differences in financial investments. </p>
<h2 id="Financial-Investments-in-Education">Financial Investments in Education<a class="anchor-link" href="#Financial-Investments-in-Education">¶</a></h2>
<p>The bar graph depicting instructional expenditure per 1000 students in 2015 highlights the stark differences in investments across the nation, with New York at the top and places like Utah and Arizona at the bottom.  This graph clearly illustrates the narrative of inequality and raises questions about the relationship between financial investments and educational quality (Figure 1). Different states can be selected by clicking the corresponding bars.</p>
<div id="vis-1" class="vis"></div>

<p class="pic-title">Figure 1: Education Expenditure vs Student Performance on Math Score</p>

<p>A deeper analysis of the line graph's depiction of educational spending trends throughout time provides insight into the US government's commitment to education.  The majority of investments are below $10,000,000, and there is a direct correlation between a state's education spending and its students' academic performance in elementary schools before 2015.  However, the correlation becomes less obvious in the years after 2015, with some states, like New York, showing a negative relationship.</p>
<p>This implies that other important factors, such as changes in policy and admissions rates may also influence academic achievement with negative contrasting relationships.</p>
<p>By moving on to the influence of economic conditions on education funding and performance, attention can be shifted toward the impact of different political landscapes across states.</p>
<h2 id="Political-Influence-on-Education-Spending">Political Influence on Education Spending<a class="anchor-link" href="#Political-Influence-on-Education-Spending">¶</a></h2>
<p>A scatter plot reveals a complex relationship, with Democratic states showing a tendency to spend more than Republican states in states' political affiliations with their education spending (Figure 2). Year can be selected with the slider.</p>

  <script src="./scripts/plot2.js"></script>

<p class="pic-title">Figure 2: Education Expenditure vs Political Party From 1993 to 2016</p>

<p>This visualization, on the other hand, depicts the picture that not only the educational expenses are funded, but also the overall expenditure across all scales of levels.  For example, the size of the bubbles representing student enrollment may reflect the return on investment and the richness of this context. This implies that the Democrats have a higher education rate and emphasize the importance of education investments than that of the Republicans.</p>
<p>The influence of political decisions on education funding leads to a discussion of individual-level outcomes, particularly how education levels are associated with economic success in different regions. 
</p>
<h2 id="Educational-Attainment-and-Economic-Outcomes">Educational Attainment and Personal Income<a class="anchor-link" href="#Educational-Attainment-and-Economic-Outcomes">¶</a></h2>
<p>A heat map that compares counties' bachelor's degree attainment to personal income highlights the link between education and economic growth. The visualization reveals a positive correlation: locations with higher educational attainment (such as Teton, Wyoming) have higher per capita income (Figure 3).  It implies that investment in education is important not only for public policy but also for individual economic prosperity. The range of bachelor degree percentage and personal income can be selected on the heat map.</p>

<p class="pic-title">Figure 3: Education Level vs Personal Income by Counties</p>

<p>Moreover, the majority of counties comparatively remain at a low level of the domain, indicating that few counties remain at higher income and education levels. This suggests that the investments and returns in education may only be deployed in particular regions, which accelerates the disparities in educational resources. </p>
<p>By establishing a link between education and economic success, the narrative leads to a discussion of the broader societal impacts of educational disparities, specifically how educational disparities relate to societal challenges such as crime rates.
</p>
<h2 id="Education-and-Incarceration-Rates">Education and Incarceration Rates<a class="anchor-link" href="#Education-and-Incarceration-Rates">¶</a></h2>
<p>Finally, a detailed scatter plot shows the inverse connection between education and incarceration rates, as a full dashboard combines a U.S. map, pie chart, and scatter plot to provide a holistic view of education's impact on crime and societal stability (Figure 4). States can either be selected from the geographic map or the scatter plot.</p>

  <script src="./scripts/plot4.js"></script>

<p class="pic-title">Figure 4: Prisoner vs. Higher Education by State</p>

<p>It is surprising to note that, while higher prisoner rates in states such as Arizona, Delaware, and Alaska are presented, the higher education level across all states in 2016 made up most of some college or associate degrees regardless of prisoner rate according to the pie chart. 
</p>
<p>The data indicates that investing in education could be a potent tactic for social change, lowering incarceration rates and promoting a more fair society, as the visualization demonstrates that greater education rates generally correspond with lower prison rates.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion:">Conclusion:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Conclusion:">¶</a></h2>
<p>These visual narratives highlight the interconnectedness of our society's structures and the profound impact of education on various aspects of life in America. They serve policymakers, educators, and society as a whole to consider the consequences of their choices and prioritize education as a cornerstone for holistic development. 
</p>
<p>Our research leverages the power of data visualization to tell a story that cannot be told with just numbers. Given that education is a cornerstone that supports a great deal of what is essential to American society, it offers clarity and understanding. This narrative sheds light on the intricate influences of money, politics, and social values that shape the education system in the U.S. and the lives of students and communities.
