<p>In a nation as diverse and expansive as the United States, the narrative of education is not just about learning and schooling—it is a story of financial, political, social, criminal, and much more. The various influences on U.S. education are complex and continue to present issues that are yet to be solved. A significant portion of these issues can be attributed to disparities and injustices within the educational system, with a majority of them stemming from differences in financial investments. </p>
<h2 id="Financial-Investments-in-Education">Financial Investments in Education<a class="anchor-link" href="#Financial-Investments-in-Education">¶</a></h2>
<p>The bar graph detailing instructional expenditure per 1000 students in 2015 reveals striking disparities across the nation. In the bar chart below, New York stands at the forefront, investing significantly more than states like Utah or Arizona, which anchors the spectrum's opposite end. The graphic's descending bars illustrate a narrative of inequality, posing critical questions about the correlation between financial investment and educational quality(Figure 1).</p>
<div id="vis-1"></div>

<p class="pic-title">Figure 1: Education Expenditure vs Student Performance on Math Score</p>

<p>A deeper analysis of educational spending trends over the years, as shown in the line graph, paints a picture of America's commitment to education. The majority of investments are below $10,000,000, and there is a direct correlation between a state's education spending and its students' academic performance in elementary schools before 2015.  However, the correlation becomes less obvious in the years after 2015, with some states, like New York, showing a negative relationship.</p>
<p>For states that show a negative correlation, it suggests that other critical factors, such as policy changes and admission rates, may also influence academic performance.</p>
<p>Moving on to the influence of economic conditions on education funding and performance, attention can be shifted towards the impact of different political landscapes across states.</p>
<h2 id="Political-Influence-on-Education-Spending">Political Influence on Education Spending<a class="anchor-link" href="#Political-Influence-on-Education-Spending">¶</a></h2><p>A scatter plot correlating states' political affiliations with their education spending reveals a complex relationship, with Democratic states showing a tendency to spend more than Republican states. The size of the bubbles representing student enrollment also adds nuance to this context (Figure 2).</p>

<p class="pic-title">Figure 2: Education Expenditure vs Political Party in 2005</p>

<p>This visualization, on the other hand, depicts the picture that not only the educational expenses are funded, but also the overall expenditure across all scales of levels. This implies that the Democrats have a higher education rate and emphasize the importance of education investments than that of the Republicans.</p>
<p>The influence of political decisions on education funding leads to a discussion of individual-level outcomes, particularly how education levels are associated with economic success in different regions.</p>
<h2 id="Educational-Attainment-and-Economic-Outcomes">Educational Attainment and Economic Outcomes<a class="anchor-link" href="#Educational-Attainment-and-Economic-Outcomes">¶</a></h2><p>The relationship between education and economic prosperity becomes palpable through a heat map juxtaposing counties' bachelor's degree attainment against personal income. The visualization elucidates a positive correlation: regions with higher educational attainment(such as Teton, WY) tend to have greater per capita income(Figure 3).  It suggests that investment in education is not only a matter of public policy but also key to individual economic prosperity.</p>

<div id="vis-3"></div>
  <script src="./scripts/plot3.js"></script>

<p class="pic-title">Figure 3: Education Level vs Personal Income by Counties</p>

<p>Moreover, the majority of counties are relatively staying at a low level of the domain, meaning that there are not many counties that stay at higher education and income, implying that the education investments and returns may only deploy to specific regions, further speeding up the disparities of education resources.</p>
<p>By establishing a link between education and economic success, the narrative naturally leads to a discussion of the broader societal impacts of educational disparities, specifically how educational disparities relate to societal challenges such as crime rates.</p>
<h2 id="Education-and-Incarceration-Rates">Education and Incarceration Rates<a class="anchor-link" href="#Education-and-Incarceration-Rates">¶</a></h2><p>Finally, a nuanced scatter plot demonstrates the inverse relationship between education and incarceration rates, with a comprehensive dashboard combining a U.S. map, pie chart, and scatter plot to present a multifaceted view of the impact of education on crime and social stability (Figure 4).</p>

<div id="vis-4"></div>
  <script src="./scripts/plot4.js"></script>

<p class="pic-title">Figure 4: Prisoner vs. Higher Education by State</p>

<p>It is surprising to note that, while higher prisoner rates in states such as Arizona, Delaware, and Alaska are presented, the higher education level across all states in 2016 made up most of some college or associate degrees regardless of prisoner rate according to the pie chart.</p>
<p>As the visualization suggests higher education rates generally correspond with lower prison rates, the data suggests that investment in education could be a powerful strategy for social change, reducing incarceration rates and fostering a more equitable society.</p>
<h2 id="Conclusion:">Conclusion:<a class="anchor-link" href="#Conclusion:">¶</a></h2>
<p>These visual narratives highlight the interconnectedness of our society's structures and the profound impact of education on various aspects of life in America. They serve as a call to action for policymakers, educators, and society as a whole to consider the consequences of their choices and prioritize education as a cornerstone for holistic development. </p>
<p>Our investigation leverages the power of data visualization to tell a story that numbers alone cannot. It provides clarity and insight as education stands as a pillar that upholds much of what is crucial in American life. By leveraging the power of data visualization, this narrative sheds light on the intricate influences of money, politics, and social values that shape the education system in the U.S. and the lives of students and communities.</p>
